# Introduction

This document compares the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) diseases burden for three countries: Egypt, Nigeria and Uganda. We compare the burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNN), and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Overall disease burden for these countries is not included in this report. 

The source data is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.
